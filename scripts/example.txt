Here are a few examples of special characters commonly used in writing:
	•	Em dash (—) — used to set off a phrase or add emphasis.
Example: He was certain—absolutely certain—that it would work.
	•	En dash (–) – used for ranges or relationships.
Example: The meeting is scheduled for 3–5 PM.
	•	Ellipsis (…) … used to indicate omission or a pause.
Example: Well… I’m not sure that’s a good idea.

Would you like me to include more special punctuation marks, such as typographic quotes (like “ ” or ‘ ’) or section symbols (§)?
